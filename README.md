# Overview

This is a quick and dirty script which renames my daily notes from a certain naming format e.g. `20230813000000_daily_notes_Sunday.md` to a different one e.g. `2023-08-13`, making use of [obsidian-cli](https://github.com/Yakitrak/obsidian-cli/) to help rename links in my obsidian vault as well.

# Notes

- create a quick python script that is able to call out to shell cli
- list out notes matching the pattern and for each one print the updated name
- run the move command with `obsidian-cli
